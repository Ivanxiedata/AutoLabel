Objective
The objective of this project is to streamline the label processing workflow for drop shipping logistics by automating the validation and enrichment of raw labels.
This solution aims to reduce manual errors, improve efficiency, and eliminate the need for workers to cross-check labels with external documents, thereby optimizing the shipping process.

Project Description
This project provides an end-to-end solution for handling raw labels and an Excel sheet containing product names and quantities.
The pipeline validates the labels, checks for null values, and enriches them by adding key metrics like product names and quantities.
The finalized, marked labels are then ready for drop shipping logistics, eliminating the need for workers to cross-reference each label with an Excel sheet during processing.
